**Nelm** is meant to be a direct **Helm 3** replacement, providing first-class **Helm-chart** support, yet improving on what **Helm 3** offers.

**Nelm** is used as the deployment engine in [werf](https://github.com/werf/werf/), but **Nelm** will have its own CLI in the future for those who don't need everything that werf offers.

**Nelm** is based on **Helm 3** â€” some parts of it improved and some, like the deployment subsystem, are rewritten from scratch to introduce:
* `terraform plan`-like capabilities
* Replacement of 3-Way Merge with Server-Side Apply
* Improved resource tracking built from the ground up
* Advanced resource ordering capabilities
* Flexible resource lifecycle management
* Fixes for numerous issues like [this one](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219) and other improvements

## Getting started with Nelm via werf

1. Download [werf](https://github.com/werf/werf/releases/latest)
2. Create new project:
```bash
git init myproject
cd myproject
mkdir .helm

cat > .helm/Chart.yaml <<EOF

EOF

cat > .gitignore <<EOF
/.helm/charts/*.tgz

werf helm dependency update .helm
git add .
git commit -m init
```
3. Check what's going to happen on next release:
```bash

4. Deploy new release:
```bash
werf converge --env dev
```
